# Gadget Ghar - E-commerce Web App

Although its a clich√© project. it is something to show my react skills. There are more projects to come Gadget Ghar is a full-featured e-commerce web application for electronics and gadgets, built
with React and Redux. It provides a seamless shopping experience for both guests and logged-in users, with robust state persistence, user feedback, and all essential e-commerce flows.

## Features

- **Product Details**: View detailed information, add to cart or wishlist, and see related products.
